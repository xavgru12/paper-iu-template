This bachelor thesis is about two topics as Software-in-the-Loop test strategy. One topic is
Interface Testing; the other one is Equivalence Classes. Both topics are worked out within TPT, which
is a software for testing embedded systems by the company PikeTec. Steps for Interface Testing include
analyzing the existing Interface Test, modelling a C source and automatically generating test cases using TPT.
A concept for Equivalence Classes is pointed out, which is about validating existing Software-in-the-Loop tests
and self-tests checking if the defined Equivalence Classes are reached. It is explained that defining the latter is a way of creating
a database that can be used for further tests.
